## Training the Model
You can train your model running the above scripts
and obtain the following files:
* mhcb.h5
* classes.pkl
* words.pkl

The above files are used in the main application, the intents.json() dataset can be found from Kaggle which can be found here: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvis23/mental-health-conversational-data)
```
You can also train the model in other ways other than SGD
```
